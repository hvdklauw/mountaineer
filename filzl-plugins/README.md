# filzl-plugins

Our plugins are still in active development. We're working on a few different plugins to help you get started with your filzl project. Here's a list of what we're working on:

- [filzl-auth](./filzl-auth)
- [filzl-daemons](./filzl-daemons)

Our initial thinking with plugins is a bit different than our thinking with the core library. Plugins provide strongly opinionated implementations of simple patterns. These will likely not be a good fit for all projects or companies.

Instead, they're intended as simple implementations that you can use as the beginning of a new project - or reference implementations that you can branch and release as another plugin for the community.
